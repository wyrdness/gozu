      "full": "Gozu (牛頭, 'Cow Head') is a unique Japanese urban legend that functions as a meta-narrative—a story about a dangerous story. According to the legend, Gozu is a narrative so terrifying, disturbing, or cognitively hazardous that anyone who hears it suffers severe psychological or physical consequences, including illness, madness, and death. The most common version describes a 1980s incident where a teacher on a school bus trip began telling students a story called 'Gozu.' Despite students begging him to stop as they fell ill, the teacher—seemingly entranced or compelled—continued until he collapsed. The students reportedly experienced fever, psychological trauma, and in some versions, long-term mental effects. Crucially, the actual content of the Gozu story is completely unknown—no one can remember or recount it. This makes Gozu a pure concept of dangerous knowledge, a legend sustained entirely by its absence. The name may derive from Buddhist hell guardians (Gozu-mekki, ox-headed demons) or from Gozu-Tennō, a Buddhist-Shinto syncretic deity associated with disease and protection."
