## Note on Source Reliability

**Tiers of Reliability**:

**Tier 1 (High Reliability)**:
- Academic peer-reviewed sources
- Published folklore studies
- Documented historical events (for context)

**Tier 2 (Moderate Reliability)**:
- Non-peer-reviewed academic writing
- Journalistic coverage
- Author interviews and statements

**Tier 3 (Cultural Documentation)**:
- Internet forums and discussions
- Popular media coverage
- Fan communities

**Tier 4 (Low Reliability)**:
- Anonymous claims
- Unverified witness accounts
- "Friend of a friend" stories

**For Gozu Specifically**: No Tier 1 or Tier 2 sources verify the actual incident. All documentation is Tier 3-4, treating Gozu as an urban legend rather than verified event.

---

## Research Ethics Statement

Researchers engaging with Gozu legend should:

1. **Avoid Fabrication**: Do not create false evidence or sources
2. **Respect Cultural Context**: Acknowledge Japanese cultural origins
3. **Psychological Safety**: Provide content warnings for disturbing material
4. **Academic Integrity**: Clearly distinguish legend from fact
5. **Responsible Sharing**: Avoid sensationalizing or presenting legend as verified truth

---

## Conclusion

The Gozu legend, while lacking verified historical documentation, sits at the intersection of multiple academic disciplines: folklore, psychology, information theory, cultural studies, and philosophy. This bibliography provides resources for understanding Gozu within these contexts, recognizing it as a significant cultural phenomenon regardless of historical factuality.

The absence of primary sources is itself significant, making Gozu a unique case study in modern folklore where the legend's structure—a story about an absent story—becomes the primary object of study.
